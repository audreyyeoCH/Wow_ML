# spatial_stat_educ

When I started my MSci Biostatistics degree at the University of Zurich, in the odd semester in Spring 2018, the flavour of the Biostatistics Journal Club (run every semester or so) was Spatial statistics. I was petrified. Our prof lent us books I would never have felt an affinity to, until I learned about the wonderful possibilities that spatial statistics, in particular point level reference data, can be applied in. Namely, economics, public health and georgraphy. 

Please find my poster and presentation (cred to project buddy for moral support too) in situ. I felt like it was a success and the graphics very clear for a novice, about to start on a learning journey in spatial statistics !
